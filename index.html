               The Federation International del’Automobile (FIA) aims to make Formula 1 sustainable sport by achieving carbon NetZero by 2030, with significant reductions in emissions been made to the sport since 2018. Efforts to achieve this include the use of sustainable fuels, renewable energy and reviewing logistics. Whilst some improvements have been made it could be argued that more focus is needed on how to reduce emissions concerned with logistics.

              The goal for Federation International del’Automobile (FIA, ) is to be carbon net zero in 2030, one key initiative underpinning this is emissions from factories and facilities reduced by 34000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), 50% reduction since 2018, Formula 1(2025).This was achieved by use of renewable energy at Formula 1 sites and team locations Jeesen,J (2025). Overall, there has been a 26% reduction in carbon emissions in the sport, at the end of 2024 season the carbon footprint stood at 168720 tCO2e down from 228793 tCO2e in 2018 Marino,P (2025).

          Emissions through travel have reduced by 20,000 tCO2e, a reduction by 25% from 2018 by increased use of remote broadcast operations and teams investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SFA) for race travel. 80% of the reduction is due to the change in aviation fuel and the European leg is delivered by a fleet of bio fuelled trucks hence reducing emissions by 83 % compared to petrol.2024 geographic improvements of races were analysed and race destinations in Europe were consolidated in one leg which eliminated additional transatlantic crossing of vital equipment and freight Marino,P (2025).
          
          The Formula 1 cars only account for 1% of emissions and the FIA 2026 regulations include nearly 50,50 splits between the internal combustion engine and electric power. One project Formula1 are planning is to pursue the use of advanced sustainable fuels in all Formula 1 cars which could be transferrable for road cars and other forms of transport, Darley,J (2025) In 2024 Formula 2 and Formula 3 cars ran on advanced sustainable fuel blend and the FIA safety cars operated with 40% blend. The plan is Formula 1 to be fuelled entirely by advanced sustainable fuel in 2026 along with new hybrid engines and reduction of carbon, Formula 1(2025),Harrington,T (2024).  
          
          Emissions from logistics have reduced by 6438 tCO2 e compared to 2018 a 9% reduction achieved by significant investment in new freight containers to allow the use of more efficient aviation using Boeing 777, FIA, FIA (2019). These planes also led to 9000 t CO2 e reduction and 2024 investment with DHL and Qatar airways in SFA reduced total related emissions by more than 8000 tCO2 e a 19% reduction,Formula 1 (2025), Hargreaves, L (2025) Harrington,T (2024).
          
          Event operations emissions have decreased by 12% on race-by-race basis achieved by transition to renewable energy and key suppliers adapting their operations to lower emissions. However, since 2018 the addition of three Grand Prix has led to 247 tCO2e increase. Remote working of approximately one hundred and forty personnel each race weekend reduces the need for equipment and carbon footprint due to reduction in travel, FIA.80% of race promoters power supply are using alternative energy sources including biofuels and solar panels. To reduce event- energy emissions at all European Grand Prix FIA are using renewable sources such as hydrotreated vegetable oil, biofuels, solar panels and batteries in key areas like Pit Lane and Event Technical Centre, Formula 1(2025) Jessen,J (2025), L,J(2023).
          
          In the 2024 season all Formula 1 cars drove using Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)approved Pirelli tyres. The natural rubber in the tyre components complies with the FSC strict standards for sustainable forestry, Formula 1 (2025). All tyres bought to the track for Grand Prix weekend are transformed into secondary raw materials after use. Furthermore, Pirelli uses 100% certified renewable sources to produce the tyres and deploy virtual design technology allowing reduction in development time and cuts material wastage in prototypes, Formula1 (2025). 
          <h4 id="Criticisms">Criticisms</h4>
          
          While Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) represent a significant step forward in reducing carbon emissions, there are several challenges associated with their widespread adoption. Firstly, the production of SAFs is currently limited and often more expensive than conventional jet fuel, making large-scale implementation difficult, Ortega, R (2024). Additionally, the supply chain for SAFs is not yet fully developed, which can lead to logistical complications and inconsistent availability at race locations. There are also concerns regarding the sustainability of feedstocks used to produce SAFs, as some methods could compete with food production or lead to deforestation if not carefully managed, Szabo, B (2025). As Formula 1 continues to invest in SAFs, overcoming these obstacles will be crucial to ensuring the long-term viability and environmental benefits of these fuels.
          
          
          Organisations such as Irish Electric Vehicle Service argues that Formula 1 are greenwashing through distractions on technical adjustments rather than the bigger issues. Critics are sceptical about the sustainability initiatives like biofuels and hybrid engines being used as a marketing tool without tackling its huge carbon footprint. Logistics and travel have the greatest emissions which will not be solved with car technology alone. Formula 1 have concentrated on reducing single use of plastic at main events which although an environmental and sustainable factor this distracts from focus on the promotion and sponsorship of oil companies.
          
          <h4 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
          
          Formula 1 is making efforts to reduce carbon footprint, improve sustainability and be net zero by 2030 which is demonstrated in the clear emissions reduction since 2018 by 26 %. The Sustainable Aviation fuels although a step in the right direction it is still in development, limited with cost implications and logistical feasibility. Logistics is a key area for improvement, all transport options investigated and geographical Grand Prix legs better grouped like the European leg. Hopefully these issues can be overcome to ensure a more sustainable future for Formula 1.
